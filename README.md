## INTRODUCTION
This repository contains details of all the assignments completed during the course INFO 6105 - Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Professor Nik Bear Brown.

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
- Introduces the fundamental techniques for machine learning and data science engineering. 
- Discusses a variety of machine learning algorithms, along with examples of their implementation, evaluation, and best practices.
- Lays the foundation of how learning models are derived from complex data pipelines, both algorithmically and practically.
- Topics include supervised learning (parametric/nonparametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks, deep learning) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
reduction, recommender systems), based on numerous real-world case studies. 

## ASSIGNMENTS
The assignments in this repository cover a wide range of topics.

- **Assignment 1 :** ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
- **Assignment 2 :** Auto ML
- **Assignment 3 :** Model Intepretability
- **Assignment 4 :** Combining data Cleaning, feature Slection, Modelling and intepretability into a report
- **Assignment 5 :** Neural network Type Classification (TMNIST)

Each assignment folder contains detailed documentation, code files, and any additional resources necessary to understand and complete the task.
